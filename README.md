## Description

Body fat percentage refers to the relative proportions of body weight in terms of lean body mass (muscle, bone, internal organs, and connective tissue) and body fat. The ideal body fat percentage varies considerably by gender and by age. Persons with higher than the recommended range of body fat are considered to be at increased risk for disease.

The most accurate means of estimating body fat percentage are cumbersome and require specialized equipment. The “gold standard” is completely submerging a person in water and calculating the volume of the displaced water. This is what this looks like:

Physicians estimate body fat percentage from anatomical measurements (e.g., abdomen circumference) that are much easier to obtain. In this project, you should use a dataset of 13 measurements from subjects (all men) along with their bodyfat percentage. Your goal is to come up with a formula that can be used to estimate bodyfat percentage using only (some or all of) the 13 measurements. (The “density” column should not be used in this project.)

The challenge is to identify which combination of the 13 predictors will give the most accurate estimate and if transforming some of the variables will increase accuracy. You are encouraged to try a few different combinations of predictors. You can use some domain knowledge to pick the predictors.
